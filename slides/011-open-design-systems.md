  - stats likes downloads but no sort
  - something funny, missing design systems
  - look closer figma
  - can of worms, happy hour and twitter

  Then I found https://www.designsystems.com/open-design-systems/ which seemed to give me design systems with stats on likes and downloads (but oddly no way to sort them). But there was something funny going on here, I couldn’t see some of the large design systems that I know of like Material Design from Google or Polaris from Shopify. Then I look a tiny bit closer and these are only **figma** “design systems”. I won’t open the can of worms that is writing a “design system” in Figma right now, I’ll save that for the happy hour or if anyone watching wants to chat about it hit me up on twitter.
