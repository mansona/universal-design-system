  - The eember styleguie
  - already using field guide so easy to transfer to our
  - originally collection of shared components
  - asperational with no push
  - 2 things at once, RFC and octane
  - remember octane, just another update, not for non emberr and non JS
  - JS optional. angle bracket HTML like squint
  - markdown html

  The ember styleguide is already using field-guide so it should give us a great starting point to copy from. It was originally written many moons ago as collection of comopnents that were common to all of the ember apps that the Ember learning team were in charge of. It then evolved to be a somewhat aspirational declaration of components that we would like to use in our apps, but thre was never a real push to make it the predominatn definition of all styles across the ember “brand”. But then two things happeneed at the same time. We finally got the Ember Website Redesign RFC across the line and Ember Octane was becoming a thing! Do we all remember that? Ember octane was yet anothre upgrade for peoeple that have ebeen using Ember for a Decade but it actually represneteed something subtly different for non-ember or even non-JavaScript devs - a much easier learning curve.

  With Ember Octane the js file suddenly became optional, and with our amazing new angle bracket syntax you could look at an Ember tmeplate and by just squinting a little bit you could see syntax that might feel familiar to designers that have experience with HTML and that are sick of looking at JSX or strange templating systems with special attributes all over the place

  Why is this even useful? Well remember that I said you could write your documentation in Markdown? How many of you knew that html is valid in a Markdown document? Not only can you drop any arbitrary HTML in a markdown file and it will render just fine, If you’re using Field Guide you can even make use of or “almost html” Ember components in your documents
