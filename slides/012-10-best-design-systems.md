  A bit more research lead me to this great blog post on “designerup” https://designerup.co/blog/10-best-design-systems-and-how-to-learn-and-steal-from-them/

  At least we can now limit our search a bit and focus on what these folks call the “best 10 design systems”. Some of these you might have heard about already: Material design from google, Polaris from Shopify, Carbon from IBM.

  These design systems are all so extensive that you could speend hours digging into them, each of thme have different types of content all pointing you in different directions on how to think, but there are some comonalities. Most of them Talk about Typeography and Colours, some of them talk about Icons, and a few of them even talk about animation and illustration. This is clearly not a very exaustive list but I find it interesting to see what common themes crop up when trying to compare.
