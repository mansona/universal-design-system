  - try it oouto
  - interesing other things coming soon less related to design ysstems
  - more as a replacement foor ember-cli-addon-doocs, differnt talk

  So what do I want you to take away from this talk. Personally I would like loads of people to try out field-guide, it’s being in production for the ember-styleguide for a very long time now and I know I’m a bit biased but I think it’s pretty useful. We have some interesting changes coming soon, that are less design-system related and more about field-guides’s secondary goal: as a wholesale replacement for ember-cli-addon-docs. But that will have to be a story for another talk.
