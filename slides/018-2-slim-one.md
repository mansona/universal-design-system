  - bottled ember
  - goal for empress apps fewest files
  - couldn't kill all files
  - people here

  This particular example is using a little research project of mine called bottled-ember. The goal is to make it possible to run my empress apps with as few ember-specific files in the repo as possible. I haven’t been able to kill all the files, apparenetly tests/dummy/config/environment can’t be passed in the tests tree to ember-cli but I know there are at least 3 people at this conference that could help me fix the last few issues with it :joy:
