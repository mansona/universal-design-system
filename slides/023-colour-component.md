  - nice example, details and a11y
  - now thinking about html build design system
  - using as much HTML and CSS is core to universal

  This is a nice little example because not only does it show our colour and some details about it, you can also see how our text scales and text colours will fair on it in terms of accessibility. Which is super useful if you’re coming to the design system looking for a colour that you can use.

  Now that we’re in the mood for thinking about HTML, why don’t we try to  build most of your design system just using HTML and CSS. Sure if you’re using Ember you can still use Ember Components all over the place, but if you focus on HTML and CSS this is really the core of the Universal Design System that I wanted to talk about.
