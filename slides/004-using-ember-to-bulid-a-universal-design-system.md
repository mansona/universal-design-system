  - why I'm here
  - start defining (my def 20 mins)
  - real audience - who knows what I mean design sysetm
  - not if there isn't component library
  - definitions

  So back to the reason I’m standing up her, I’m here to talk to you all about using Ember to bulid a universal design system. It’s probably a good idea to start off talking about what a design system actually is (or really define what it’s going to be for the next 20 mins while you’re listening to me because I don’t think I could come up with a univeresal definition) and then I’ll eplain what I mean by a universal design system and why you would do something so silly as to build that in Embere.

  So, since I can do this with a real audience I’m going to do it! How many people here know what I mean by a design system? ok great that is a good number of hands up! there are a few uncertain hands... so lets try this then: how many of you would say that a design system isn’t a design system if it doesn’t provide you ready made components to use in your applications? ah yes, fewer hands but as you can see it’s not all agreemnet in the room of what exactly goes into a design system

  So let’s go through some definitions that I found online, and then a few examples of design systems to see if we can get on the same page before I get into the meat of the talk. and hopefully there will be a few more certain hands up by the end of this half hour!

  So let’s go through some definitions I found across the internet:
