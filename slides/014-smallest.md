  - live and not in progress
  - only one rule
  - does that count? why not? definition **systematic**
  - silly. wouldn't rcommend
  - what if I wanted to expand
  - need text, need system to handle it
  - system that's easy other people can help
  - i have a tool

  tinydesignsystem.com is live and is now officially the smallest public design system in the world. No it’s not in progress, it’s totally finished and that’s how it’s supposed to look. The only rule in this design system is “Use only HTML with no CSS styling”. what do we think? is that actually a design system? if not why not? going back to our defintion from before, it’s a systematic approach to product development. if ever you feel like you want to use some styles then don’t! simple yet effective rule.

  Of course this is me being facecious, I don’t actually recommend trying to build the next big silocone valley startup using tiny design system. Your users might not like it and you will probably stuggle to get much investmeent. BUt it does searve as a good extreme case that helps us to think about the definition of design systems.

  So what if wanted to expand on this tinydesignsystem? what if we wanted to make something like, I don’t know, mediumdesignsystem.com? how would we go about it? looking at the design systems examples so far we know at least onee thing is true, we need soomething that is useful for writing a lot of text. I also don’t want to be thee only one writing this thing beecause, truth be told I’m not much of a designer. I want to build my intermediate design system out-in-the open using a tool that is specifically designed to be a simple as possible to add documentation.

  I think I might have a tool for that!
