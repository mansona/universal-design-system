  - talk name

  Hi everyone, my name is chris manson and I’m here to talk to you about “Universal Design Systems the Ember Way”. Don’t worry, I know that name is a little different from what is on the schedule, that’s just because the other name was a bit too long to fit on this slide and I didn’t want to have to mess with it.
