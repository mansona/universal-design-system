  This is me, along with a bunch of my socials and where you can find me across the internet. You'll see that I'm pretty much real_ate everywhere apart from github, so if anyone knows anybody in github that might be convinced to allow underscores in usernames then let me know. This little fella here is one of my side-kicks, Rodney. Since Iâ€™ve last been speaking in-person at a confernece a lot has changed in the wider world but I have also aquired 3 extra side-kicks! My pandemic pup Suzie with the good smile, and I have two daughters now! How did that happen!?

  I have to say this is a bit of a strange experience being in front of people speaking again, the last time I was preparing myself for this was when I was prepping my talk for EmberConf 2020 and instead of travelling to Portland and experiencing the nerves I needed to setup a micro recoding studio to record my talk in a white void.
