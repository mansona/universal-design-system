  - doen't matter framework
  - html in dom
  - what do I mean? background shapes

  It doesn’t matter what framework or mad modern technology to build for the web you’re using, everything that you render will ultimately end up as HTML in the dom so if we can build our system with that in mind then technically we should be able to use it in any application no matter the framework.

  What do I mean by all this “focus on HTML and CSS” anyway? While working on thee ember styleguide one of my favourite achivements was the “Background Shapes” concept.
