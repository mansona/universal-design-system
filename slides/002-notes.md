  Abstract
  Thanks to the release of Ember Octane we have truly cemented ourselves as the only HTML-First framework out there. While this is great news for people writing Ember apps and for people learning Ember that might already be skilled in HTML and CSS., this talk explores some of the wider possibilities of being a HTML-first framework. I explore the possibility of building a design system with Ember that can be consumed by an app that doesn't even use JS. HTML and CSS are the common languages of the web and I will try to demonstrate how to make that a reality in the world of modern web development

  For Review Committee
  Details
  I have done a lot of work building a design system (styleguide addon) that is shared between a number of Ember apps. With only very few exceptions this design system has used HTML-first principles and does not need you to use pre-written Ember Components to consume the styleguide, instead it provides default styling designed to be used with semantic HTML and a few opt-in CSS helpers. With this in mind, you can think of the output of the design system as being a single CSS file and a documentation site detailing how to use it.

  Ember's build system provides everything you need for the CSS file and an Ember community project can provide a great documentation experience for it.

  Outline:
  - introduction to design systems
  - showing some examples of component libraries (framework specific)
  - outline HTML-first design systems (using HTML and CSS without components)
  - show how to build one of these design systems with Ember (and the documentation system I mentioned)
  - demo

  Pitch
  Ember has suddenly become the best tool for building design systems regardless of what framework you will be consuming the design system in, and this talk is meant to tell the world why and exactly how to achieve this for yourself. Hopefully this will have a wider appeal outside the Ember community too.
