  - digress
  - documentation with markdown and code examples
  - start with an intro etc.
  - don't want to start from scratch, talk too long
  - lets use something you'll be familiar with

  anyway I digress! now all you need ot do is write your documenetation in your docs foolder, writing using markdown with code examples as you would usually do with markdown. No special syntax needed

  We should start with some introduction about the design system that we want to write, give some context about how we actually want to build our styles and the motivation of what we’re doing.... but do you know what. instead of me starting from scratch here, let’s use a design system that I’ve actually already worked on and most of the people in this room should be at least a bit familiar with some sites that make use of it!
