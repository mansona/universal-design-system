  - look no components
  - not dumb

  If you look at the documentation over there you won’t see a single Ember component. This is truely HTML-first, and that doesn’t mean that it needs to be declarative and dumb. If you use hte `bg-shape-boxes-bottom ` class you get this neat little spill over into the next div without having to think about it.
