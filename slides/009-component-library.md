  - storybook, lucky document, no narative
  - strongly believe. components with api doesn't teach you to think same way
  - easy to document
  - public design systems

  And by component library I mean something like storybook that neatly lays out all of your components and if you’re lucky might even document how to use each component. What I have found is that if you’re using a component library you don’t often get much of a narative on how to think about your design and help you approach the problem.

  This is something that I strongly believe in, sure you could be given a set of componnts and some docs about their api but that doesn’t teach you how to think about design for whatever it is you’re building. You need a narative to get you thinking in the same way as your colleagues or the people who are working on the design itself.

  I also happen to believe that the documentation should be easy for anyone to contribute to, regardless of what team you’re in. But I might say a little more about that later!

  So let’s have a look at some of the public design systems out there and see if they end up feeling like Component libraries or something more systematic.
