  The one thing that you will notice is that every single one of these sites are **HUGE** and contain a lot of text. You will probably have to take a university-level course to fully understand any of these in great depth instead of just dipping in and out looking for specific things. So I thought, aren’t there any smaller design systems that could still be considered “comprehensive”?

  I did a quick search online and I couldn’t find anyone claiming to be the Smallest Design System, so I made it!
