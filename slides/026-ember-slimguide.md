  - also removed all components
  - all html and css
  - so far no special, magic deployment
  - npm cool kids
  - not just addon, universal package.
  - one weird trick

  I’ve also just removed all the components from the documentation and made sure it’s only using HTML snippets. This means that the only driving force of everything you see in this documentation is HTML and CSS.

  So far we haven’t done anything all that special. The true magic happens when we want to deploy this new thing. I’m going to deploy it to npm because that’s where all the cool kids put their stuff these days. But instead of just depeloying it as an ember addon like the styleguide is already, let’s make use of the one weird trick that makes your design system ember addon a usiversal npm package.
