notes: |
  - end up with docs folder and lots of files
  - confusing

  What you end up with is an Ember addon with a neat little docs folder that just has a bunch of markdown in it. But, this is still quite a lot of files for someone that first of all doesnâ€™t really know that we want an ember addon to use field guide or what most of these files do... can we do any better? Can we make it a bit slimmer?
