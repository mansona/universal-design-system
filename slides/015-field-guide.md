  Enter, Field Guide :tada:

  This is yet another Empress project, so anyone who has seen me talk before knows the drill. For anything empress you have a quick-start and a super-quick start that can get you up and running really quickly. I want to make this more about the documenetation so I’m going to try to set this up withotu any command line because that might be a bit tricky for someone who isn’t used to the modern web and command lines and build systems. Or to say that a different way, I don’t want lack of experience in that side of things to be a blocker to use this tool. So let’s set it up with our Super Quick Start button.
