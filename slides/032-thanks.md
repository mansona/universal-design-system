  Thank you everyone for listening. As I said at the beginning you can find me on all these places, most recently I have been streaming my open source development live on twitch on a Thursday morning. I had to skip this week because I had another engagement but I would love for you all to join me for a stream sometime.

  If you have any questions you can reach out to me on twitch or on the Ember Discord, or as I said we can natter at the happy hour later tonight too.

  Thanks
