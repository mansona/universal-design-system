  - how I imagine sweet spot
  - markdown that's easy (no seromony)
  - CSS becuase web
  - html snippets
  - that's just writing, how do we consume this
  - we've already used the super secret slim-one button
  - copy across. ember slimguide

  This is how I imagine the sweet spot of design system develeopment. A set of markdown files with very little seromony around writing them. A collection of CSS since we’re designing for the web here, and some html snippeets in the docs that show you exactly what they look like.

  but that only deals with the writing of the doc. Now that we have the perfect design system docs including all the CSS that we will need. How do I actually consume this **universal** system? Let’s go through it together with an example

  So I said that I didn’t want to writ emy own design system for this talk and i would just use the ember-styleguide, but I have already used my super secret Netlify QuickStart button and I want to use my super slimmed down repo, so I copied across all most of the files from ember-styleguide and I have renameed the project eember-slimguide.
